KBW (??         ): tag 2.1

    - Included code for DAPall file
    - Fixed error in bin area calculation in unbinned data.
    - Added convenience functions to DAPFits for use with the MAPS
      files.
    - Fixed problem with velocity offset between template and galaxy
      data due to difference in pixel sampling.

TO FIX:
    - masking in output cubes; extrapolated regions with bad
      continuum...
    - emission-line moment masks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KBW (04 Aug 2016): tag 2.0.2

    - Bug in setup for emission-line and spectral-index measurements
      when stellar continuum not fit.
    - Fixed error in return type when an emission-line fit fails, and
      report which line and spectrum failed.
    - Necessary conversions from asarray() to atleast_1d()
    - Include spot-check plotting code for maps
    - NEARBOUND is treated differently and separately applied to the
      stellar velocities and stellar velocity dispersions.  pPXF fits
      where the velocity dispersions at the lower bound do not
      *necessarily* have a bad velocity measurement.
    - Minor adjustments to TemplateLibrary and DRPComplete classes
    - Added python versions to mangampl.py and version checking to
      rundap.py; strict version compliance can be ignored if necessary
    - Added version information to dapcube.py and dapmaps.py
    - Corrected HDUCLAS2 for some MAPS extensions

KBW (26 Jul 2016): tag 2.0.1

    Removed old DAP IDL code, except for pro/mangadap_version.pro

    Fixed/added functionality:
        - Included correction for Galactic extinction; current default
          is to use the O'Donnell (1994) coefficents for the CCM
          extinction law.
        - Added MILES cluster template group.
        - Allow for choice to *not* match the spectral resolution of the
          template to that of the galaxy data, and supply templates at
          higher spectral sampling.
        - Include stellar velocity dispersion quadrature correction.
        - Included v6.0.0 of pPXF; allows analytic calculation of LOSVD
          FFT for better performance at low velocity dispersion
        - Fixed error in spectral-index masks
        - Dispersion correction separated from spectral-index
          measurements in maps file
        - Spectral-index dispersion corrections not automatically applied
        - Added config to ignore resolution matching in spectral-index
          measurements (for testing)
        - Changed the lower limit of the emission-line dispersion to be
          30 km/s, which means the line has a FWHM ~1 pixel at minimum;
          upper bound changed to 800 km/s.
        - Definition of "near" bounds for bounded kinematic fits:
            - Velocities and higher moments: Cannot be nearer to a bound
              than 1% of the full width of the allowed parameter space.
            - Velocity dispersions: Cannot be nearer to a bound than 1%
              of the LOG of the full width of the allowed parameter
              space.
          For the stellar kinematics, this means:
                  PAR         NEAR_BOUND ranges
                -----   -----------------------
                    V    -2000:-1960, 1960:2000
                sigma   6.903:7.255, 951.46:1e3
                   hN    -0.3:-0.294, 0.294:0.3
          The velocity limits for the emission-lines are dynamically
          defined by the lines in the window or to be +/- 25 angstroms
          about the line center, and no higher moments are fit at the
          moment.  So the only fixed limits are for the dispersion; any
          values within the ranges 30.:31, 774.16:800 are considered
          "near" the boundary.
        - Stellar-continuum model mask now includes NEAR_BOUND bits, if
          necessary.
        - Constructs an output model data cube with the stellar
          continuum and emission-line model as a complement to the maps
          file.
        - Allows for an iteration that modifies the stellar-continuum
          fit by unmasking and fitting the emission lines, while not
          changing the stellar kinematics.
        - Fixed problem with emission-line parameters returned for
          non-primary lines fit in each window.
        - Fixed error in construction of the Hessian (inverse
          covariance) matrix from the emission-line fits.
        - Removed SPXL_SPCOV extension; changed extension names from
          'SPXL' to 'SPX' to match binning scheme name.

    Fixed failures:
        - Bookkeeping error in emission-line moment measurements
        - Incorrect/incomplete checking for sufficient data to fit
          emission lines

KBW (08 Jun 2016): tag 2.0

    Initial tag after major refactor of DAP to be solely in python.
    Some directory cleanup performed; however, the pro/ directory is
    still included in this tag.  All further tags will have the pro/
    directory removed.
    
    This tag was used to run initial benchmark tests for the candidate
    MPL-5 data.

KBW (24 Feb 2016): tag 1.1.2
    Tag stable version of trunk before starting major revisions to
    python directory for MPL-5.

KBW (25 Jan 2016): tag 1.1.1
    Tagged version run for MPL-4.

    NOTE: Tag was created much later than MPL-4 was released.  DAP MPL-4
    release located in the mangawork/sandbox directory, and not
    maintained in the nominal MANGA_SPECTRO_ANALYSIS directory structure
    because run on ICG, Portsmouth, cluster.  Differences between tagged
    version and version that produced MPL-4 are minor and largely
    contained within the python/mangadap/plot directory.  Edits to
    plotting routines have been used for plots of MPL-4 data shown in
    Marvin.

KBW (28 Apr 2015): tag v1_0_0
    Tagged version run on MPL-3 DRP fits files.
