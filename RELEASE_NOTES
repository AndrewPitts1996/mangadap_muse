KBW (?? Jun 2016): tag 2.0.1

    Removed old DAP IDL code, except for pro/mangadap_version.pro

    Fixed/added functionality:
        - Added MILES cluster template group.
        - Allow for choice to *not* match the spectral resolution of the
          template to that of the galaxy data, and supply templates at
          higher spectral sampling.
        - Include stellar velocity dispersion quadrature correction.
        - Fixed error in spectral-index masks

    Fixed failures:
        - Bookkeeping error in emission-line moment measurements
        - Incorrect/incomplete checking for sufficient data to fit
          emission lines

KBW (08 Jun 2016): tag 2.0

    Initial tag after major refactor of DAP to be solely in python.
    Some directory cleanup performed; however, the pro/ directory is
    still included in this tag.  All further tags will have the pro/
    directory removed.
    
    This tag was used to run initial benchmark tests for the candidate
    MPL-5 data.

KBW (24 Feb 2016): tag 1.1.2
    Tag stable version of trunk before starting major revisions to
    python directory for MPL-5.

KBW (25 Jan 2016): tag 1.1.1
    Tagged version run for MPL-4.

    NOTE: Tag was created much later than MPL-4 was released.  DAP MPL-4
    release located in the mangawork/sandbox directory, and not
    maintained in the nominal MANGA_SPECTRO_ANALYSIS directory structure
    because run on ICG, Portsmouth, cluster.  Differences between tagged
    version and version that produced MPL-4 are minor and largely
    contained within the python/mangadap/plot directory.  Edits to
    plotting routines have been used for plots of MPL-4 data shown in
    Marvin.

KBW (28 Apr 2015): tag v1_0_0
    Tagged version run on MPL-3 DRP fits files.
