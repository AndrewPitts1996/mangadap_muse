KBW (??         ): tag 2.1

    - Included code for DAPall file
    - Fixed error in bin area calculation in unbinned data.
    - Added convenience functions to DAPFits for use with the MAPS
      files.
    - Fixed problem with velocity offset between template and galaxy
      data due to difference in pixel sampling.
    - Updated mangampl.py to include matplotlib version; added MPL-6
      versions
    - Fixed how the stellar-continuum-fitting masks are saved; still
      need to make sure users can reconstruct these exactly from the
      output model cube files.
    - Changed how spectral step is calculated to avoid numerical
      precision issues.
    - Incorporated M. Cappellari's gaussian_filter1d into the
      convolution_variable_sigma function in
      python/mangadap/util/instrument.py.  It's 2 orders of magnitude
      faster now!
    - Include spectral resolution handling hooks into spatial binning
      and stellar continuum fitting.  The code is compliant with data
      that both does and does not have the 'DISP' extension in the DRP
      cube file for backwards compatibility.
    - "Database" parameter classes (e.g., EmissionLineDB) have been
      moved from python/mangadap/par to python/mangadap/proc/.
    - Incorporated spaxel-by-spaxel instrumental dispersion corrections.
    - Significantly restructuring of most of the core classes to
      minimize the size of the reference files and to use common
      functions where possible (e.g., new DAPFitsUtil class).
    - Added equivalent width measurements for the Gaussian fitted
      fluxes; core function identical for the summed and Gaussian-fit
      fluxes.
    - Moved construction of main output files to dapfits.py
    - Include a map mask in reference files
    - Allow rundap to read the plate, ifu, and mode combinations to
      analyze from a file
    - Include filtering approach in stellar kinematics fitting
    - Incorporate ppxf v6.0.6
    - Reading/writing of fits data is now done using DAPFitsUtil.  When
      reading with this utility, the fits image data are automatically
      restructured into a row-major ordering to ease the confusion
      between the way astropy.io.fits provides the data and the ordering
      of the NAXIS keywords.  At the moment, this restructuring does not
      mess up the WCS coordinates in the header; however, depending on
      any development of astropy.io.fits in the future, this may become
      a problem.  This feels like a big mess at the moment, but there's
      no easy way around it.
    - Restructured how the covariance data are read and written to
      adhere to the format already adopted by the DRP.  The Covariance
      class should now be able to seemlessly read the broad-band
      correlation matrices provided in the LOGCUBE files.
    - Added DefaultConfig class to help manage config files.  Edited the
      StellarContinuumModelDef parameters to accommodate the new
      filtering approach.  Removed all but one StellarContinuumModel
      method.
    - Include an estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion correction
      based on fitting the native resolution optimized template to the
      same spectrum that has been rsolution matched to object spectrum
      being fit.
    - Changed velocity dispersion correction calculation for stellar
      kinematics: Old version used mean resolution difference between
      galaxy and template spectra.  New version uses a fit of the
      best-fitting model template to a resolution-matched version of
      itself. 
    - MAPS and LOGCUBE files set to single-precision float for survey
      output.
    - BINID in MAPS and LOGCUBE files set to int32 type for survey
      output.
    - Added NeIII and higher-order Balmer series lines (up to H10).
    - General improvements to the documentation
    - New emission-line module Sasuke that uses pPXF to fit the lines.
    - Adjusted pPXF filtering approach: remove final, fixed-kinematics
      fit and set polynomial order of initial fit to be the effective
      order of the filter (full length/smoothing box-1)
    - Calculate and include nominal errors in template weights in output
      reference file for stellar continuum model.
    - HARDCODED: Use first moment of H-alpha as the initial velocity
      guess for the emission lines.
    - Include pre-pixelized Gaussian extension from DRP.
    - Use 'z' column in plateTargets files to construct input parameter
      files instead of the 'nsa_z' column; this should catch the
      ancillaries not in the NSA but with redshifts in the targeting
      catalog.
    - In rundap, wait for cluster processes to finish then also submit a
      script to construct the DAPall file

TO FIX:
    - emission-line moment masks
    - Documentation of config examples are out of date!

KBW (04 Aug 2016): tag 2.0.2

    - Bug in setup for emission-line and spectral-index measurements
      when stellar continuum not fit.
    - Fixed error in return type when an emission-line fit fails, and
      report which line and spectrum failed.
    - Necessary conversions from asarray() to atleast_1d()
    - Include spot-check plotting code for maps
    - NEARBOUND is treated differently and separately applied to the
      stellar velocities and stellar velocity dispersions.  pPXF fits
      where the velocity dispersions at the lower bound do not
      *necessarily* have a bad velocity measurement.
    - Minor adjustments to TemplateLibrary and DRPComplete classes
    - Added python versions to mangampl.py and version checking to
      rundap.py; strict version compliance can be ignored if necessary
    - Added version information to dapcube.py and dapmaps.py
    - Corrected HDUCLAS2 for some MAPS extensions

KBW (26 Jul 2016): tag 2.0.1

    Removed old DAP IDL code, except for pro/mangadap_version.pro

    Fixed/added functionality:
        - Included correction for Galactic extinction; current default
          is to use the O'Donnell (1994) coefficents for the CCM
          extinction law.
        - Added MILES cluster template group.
        - Allow for choice to *not* match the spectral resolution of the
          template to that of the galaxy data, and supply templates at
          higher spectral sampling.
        - Include stellar velocity dispersion quadrature correction.
        - Included v6.0.0 of pPXF; allows analytic calculation of LOSVD
          FFT for better performance at low velocity dispersion
        - Fixed error in spectral-index masks
        - Dispersion correction separated from spectral-index
          measurements in maps file
        - Spectral-index dispersion corrections not automatically applied
        - Added config to ignore resolution matching in spectral-index
          measurements (for testing)
        - Changed the lower limit of the emission-line dispersion to be
          30 km/s, which means the line has a FWHM ~1 pixel at minimum;
          upper bound changed to 800 km/s.
        - Definition of "near" bounds for bounded kinematic fits:
            - Velocities and higher moments: Cannot be nearer to a bound
              than 1% of the full width of the allowed parameter space.
            - Velocity dispersions: Cannot be nearer to a bound than 1%
              of the LOG of the full width of the allowed parameter
              space.
          For the stellar kinematics, this means:
                  PAR         NEAR_BOUND ranges
                -----   -----------------------
                    V    -2000:-1960, 1960:2000
                sigma   6.903:7.255, 951.46:1e3
                   hN    -0.3:-0.294, 0.294:0.3
          The velocity limits for the emission-lines are dynamically
          defined by the lines in the window or to be +/- 25 angstroms
          about the line center, and no higher moments are fit at the
          moment.  So the only fixed limits are for the dispersion; any
          values within the ranges 30.:31, 774.16:800 are considered
          "near" the boundary.
        - Stellar-continuum model mask now includes NEAR_BOUND bits, if
          necessary.
        - Constructs an output model data cube with the stellar
          continuum and emission-line model as a complement to the maps
          file.
        - Allows for an iteration that modifies the stellar-continuum
          fit by unmasking and fitting the emission lines, while not
          changing the stellar kinematics.
        - Fixed problem with emission-line parameters returned for
          non-primary lines fit in each window.
        - Fixed error in construction of the Hessian (inverse
          covariance) matrix from the emission-line fits.
        - Removed SPXL_SPCOV extension; changed extension names from
          'SPXL' to 'SPX' to match binning scheme name.

    Fixed failures:
        - Bookkeeping error in emission-line moment measurements
        - Incorrect/incomplete checking for sufficient data to fit
          emission lines

KBW (08 Jun 2016): tag 2.0

    Initial tag after major refactor of DAP to be solely in python.
    Some directory cleanup performed; however, the pro/ directory is
    still included in this tag.  All further tags will have the pro/
    directory removed.
    
    This tag was used to run initial benchmark tests for the candidate
    MPL-5 data.

KBW (24 Feb 2016): tag 1.1.2
    Tag stable version of trunk before starting major revisions to
    python directory for MPL-5.

KBW (25 Jan 2016): tag 1.1.1
    Tagged version run for MPL-4.

    NOTE: Tag was created much later than MPL-4 was released.  DAP MPL-4
    release located in the mangawork/sandbox directory, and not
    maintained in the nominal MANGA_SPECTRO_ANALYSIS directory structure
    because run on ICG, Portsmouth, cluster.  Differences between tagged
    version and version that produced MPL-4 are minor and largely
    contained within the python/mangadap/plot directory.  Edits to
    plotting routines have been used for plots of MPL-4 data shown in
    Marvin.
