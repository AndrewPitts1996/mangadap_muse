The MaNGA data-analysis pipeline (MaNGA DAP) is the survey-led software
package that analyzes the data produced by the MaNGA data-reduction
pipeline (MaNGA DRP) to produced physical properties derived from the
MaNGA spectroscopy.

These quantities currently include:

 * Spatially stacked spectra
 * Stellar kinematics
 * Nebular emission-line properties: fluxes, equivalent widths, and
   kinematics
 * Spectral indices: absorption-line (e.g., H-delta) and bandhead/color
   (e.g., TiO, D4000) measurements

All survey-led properties are derived from the datacubes, specifically
the LOGCUBE files.  However, the core functions are developed to
consider each spectrum largely independently.  The DAP currently focuses
on "model-independent" properties.  Higher-level, model-dependent
properties, such as stellar-population parameters, will be included in
future releases on a best-effort basis.

    This documentation is for the most recent tag of the DAP.  If you're
    looking for DR15 documentation, see the `DR15 MaNGA Overview
    <https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/>`_.

The MaNGA DAP software was written to be more broadely useful.  The
pages above provide some examples of how the code can be used more
generally, beyond its application to MaNGA.
