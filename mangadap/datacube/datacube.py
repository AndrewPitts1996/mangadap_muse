class DataCube:
    r"""
    Base container class for a rectilinear datacube.

    Datacubes have three axes: two spatial coordinates and one
    spectral. The datacubes are expected to be rectilinear; i.e.,
    each spatial position has the same spectral range and each
    wavelength channel has the same spatial coordinates.

    On input, the ordering of the three dimensions can be arbitrary;
    however, the axes are re-ordered for the internal attributes such
    that wavelengths are ordered along the last axis, with the first
    two axes being the spatial coordinates. Nominally the spatial
    coordinates are ordered predominantly coincident with
    right-ascension (E toward smaller pixels numbers in axis 0) and
    declination (N toward larger pixel numbers in axis 1); however,
    rotation of the datacube spatial coordinates can be non-zero with
    respect to the celestial coordinates, as given by the provided
    world-coordinate system.

    The wavelength vector applicable to all spatial positions can
    either be provided directly or constructed from the provided WCS.
    Any directly provided ``wave`` vector takes precedence over the
    WCS.

    Spatial covariance/correlation can be provided via the ``covar``
    keyword argument. If provided as a single array, the provided
    array is used to define the *correlation* matrix and is assumed
    to be identical for all wavelength channels. More options are
    available if the input is provided as a
    :class:`mangadap.util.covariance.Covariance` object. The ordering
    of the covariance/correlation matrix is expected to provide the
    correlation between the row-major flattened version of the
    spatial coordinates. That is, for a datacube with spatial shape
    :math:`(N_x,N_y)`, the covariance/correlation value at location
    :math:`i,j` is the correlation between pixels at 2D locations
    :math:`(i_x,i_y)` and :math:`(j_x,j_y)`, where

    ..math::

        \begin{array}{rcl}
        i_x & = & \lfloor i/N_y \rfloor, \\
        i_y & = & i - i_x N_y, \\
        j_x & = & \lfloor j/N_y \rfloor, and \\
        j_y & = & j - j_x N_y.
        \end{array}

    If the values of ``axes`` indicates that the provided flux array
    should have it's spatial axes transposed (i.e. ``axes[0] >
    axes[1]``), the provided covariance/correlation data is
    appropriately restructured to correspond to the wavelength
    channels in :attr:`flux` (again assuming a flattened row-major
    memory block); see
    :func:`mangadap.util.covariance.Covariance.transpose_raw_shape`.
    
    Derived classes should, in particular, provide the read methods.
    The critical components of the derived classes are:

    .. todo::

        Fill this in.

    Args:
        flux (`numpy.ndarray`_):
            Data array with the flux as a function of spatial and
            spectral position. Shape should be :math:`(N_x, N_y,
            N_\lambda)`.
        wave (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The wavelength vector associated with each spatial
            position. Shape is :math:`(N_\lambda,)`. If None, ``wcs``
            must be provided such that the wavelength vector can be
            constructed.
        ivar (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The inverse variance of the flux array. Shape must be the
            same as ``flux``.  If None, errors are ignored.
        mask (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            Mask array for the flux measurements. Can be a boolean
            mask (False=unmasked,good; True=masked,bad) or an integer
            array associated with the provided
            :class:`mangadap.util.bitmask.BitMask` object (see
            ``bitmask``). Shape must be the same as ``flux``.
        bitmask (:class:`mangadap.util.bitmask.BitMask`, optional):
            Object used to select and toggle masked pixels from
            :attr:`mask`. If None, any provided ``mask`` must be a

        sres (`numpy.ndarray`_, optional):
            The spectral resolution, :math:`R = \lambda /
            \Delta\lambda`. Can be a single vector with shape
            :math:`(N_\lambda,)`, if the spectral resolution is
            independent of spatial position, or a 3D datacube with a
            spatially and spectrally dependent resolution with a
            shape that matches ``flux``. If None, spectral resolution
            is ignored.
        covar (array-like, :class:`mangadap.util.covariance.Covariance`, optional):
            The spatial covariance in one or more wavelength
            channels. If None, no covariance is assumed. See usage

            The axes with the :math:`x`, :math:`y`, and
            :math:`\lambda` in the provided flux array. For example,
            ``[2,1,0]`` means the spectra are organized along the
            first axis.
        wcs (`astropy.wcs.WCS`_, optional):
            World-coordinate system for the 3D datacube. If None,

            pixelscale in arcsec (see ``pixelscale``).
        pixelscale (:obj:`int`, :obj:`float`, optional):
            Spatial extent in arcsec of each spaxel in the datacube,
            assumed to be square. Superseded by ``wcs``, if the
            latter is provided. If the ``wcs`` is not provided and
            the pixelscale is not provided upon instantiation, it is
            set to unity.
        log (:obj:`bool`, optional):
            Flag that the datacube spectral pixels are binned
            logarithmically in wavelength.
        meta (:obj:`dict`, optional):

            A free-form dictionary used to hold meta data relevant to

        pixelscale (:obj:`float`):
            Spatial extent in arcsec of each spaxel in the datacube,

        bitmask (:class:`mangadap.util.bitmask.BitMask`):
            Object used to select and toggle masked pixels from
            :attr:`mask`.  Can be None.
        log (:obj:`bool`):

            \rho_{ij} = \exp(-D_{ij}^2 / 2\sigma_{\rho}^2)

        where :math:`D_{ij}` is the distance between two spaxels in
        the spatial dimension of the datacube (in the number spaxels,
        not arcsec). Any pixels with :math:`D_{ij} > R_{\rm lim}` is
        set to zero, where :math:`R_{\rm lim}` is the limiting radius
        of the kernel used in the datacube rectification; this is
        provided here as ``rlim`` in arcsec, which is converted to
        spaxels using :attr:`pixelscale`.

        We found in Westfall et al. (2019, AJ, 158, 231) that this is
        a reasonable approximation for the formal covariance that
        results from Shepard's rectification method.

        There is an unknown relation between the dispersion of the
        kernel used by Shepard's method and the value of
        :math:`\sigma_{\rho}`. Tests show that it is tantalizingly
        close to :math:`\sigma_{\rho} = \sqrt{2}\sigma`, where
        :math:`\sigma` is in pixels instead of arcsec; however, a
        formal derivation of this hasn't been done and is complicated
        by the focal-plane sampling of the row-stacked spectra.

        Within the limits of how the focal-plane sampling changes
        with wavelength, we found the value of :math:`\sigma_{\rho}`
        varies little with wavelength in MaNGA. Here, we assume
        :math:`\sigma_{\rho}` is fully wavelength independent.
        Therefore, once this method is run once, it doesn't need to
        be run again for different wavelength channels. To force the
        correlation matrix to be recreated, use ``redo`` or change
        the provided :math:`\sigma_{\rho}`.

        the covariance matrix for each wavelength channel.

        If :attr:`approx_correl` is not yet constructed (see
        :func:`approximate_correlation_matrix`), ``sigma_rho`` and
        ``rlim`` must be provided.
        
        Args:
            channels (:obj:`int`, array-like, optional):
                Indices of the spectral channels for which to
                calculate the covariance matrix. If None, the
                covariance matrix is calculated for *all* channels.
            sigma_rho (:obj:`float`, optional):
                The :math:`\sigma_{\rho}` of the Gaussian function
                used to approximate the trend of the correlation
                coefficient with spaxel separation.
            rlim (:obj:`float`, optional):
                The limiting radius of the image reconstruction
                (Gaussian) kernel in arcseconds.
            csr (:obj:`bool`, optional):
                Instead of returning a
                :class:`mangadap.util.covariance.Covariance` object,
                return the covariance matrix as a
                `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`_ object. Primarily used by
                :func:`approximate_covariance_cube` for collating the
                covariance matrix of each wavelength channel before
                combining them into a single
                :class:`mangadap.util.covariance.Covariance` object.
            quiet (:obj:`bool`, optional):
                Suppress terminal output

        Returns:
            :class:`mangadap.util.covariance.Covariance`,
            `numpy.ndarray`_: If ``csr`` is True, the returned object
            is an `numpy.ndarray`_ of `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`_
            types.
