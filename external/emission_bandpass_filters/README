# Columns in the emission-line bandpass filter database parameter files
# are:
#
#   INDEX:      
#       Unique integer identifier of the emission line.  Used when tying
#       lines together.
#   NAME:
#       Name of the element, read as a string.
#   LAMBDA:
#       Rest frame wavelength of the emission line to analyze.
#   PRIMARY:   
#       A two-element vector with the starting and ending wavelength for
#       the primary bandpass surrounding the emission line(s).
#   BLUESIDE:   
#       A two-element vector with the starting and ending wavelength for
#       a bandpass to the blue of the primary band.  Used to set the
#       continuum level near the emission line.
#   REDSIDE:
#       A two-element vector with the starting and ending wavelength for
#       a bandpass to the red of the primary band.  Used to set the
#       continuum level near the emission line.
#
#   All wavelengths (LAMBDA, PRIMARY, BLUESIDE, and REDSIDE) must be in
#   either air or vacuum.  The DAP assumes the input is in VACUUM if not
#   specified in the definition of the database using
#   :class:`EmissionMomentsDBDef`.
