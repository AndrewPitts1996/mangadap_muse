# Columns in the emission-line database parameter files are:
#
#   INDEX:
#       Unique integer identifier of the emission line.  Used when tying
#       lines together.
#   NAME:
#       Name of the element, read as a string.
#   LAMBDA:
#       Rest frame wavelength of the emission line to fit; can be in air
#       or vacuum.  DAP assumes the input is in VACUUM if not specified
#       in the definition of the database using
#       :class:`EmissionLineDBDef`
#   WAVEREF:
#       Set the reference frame of the wavelengths provided to be in
#       either air or vacuum using the keywords 'air' or 'vac',
#       respectively.
#   ACTION:
#       Describes how the line should be treated.  Possible values are:
#
#           'i': ignore the line, as if the line were commented out.
#
#           'f': fit the line and mask the line when fitting the stellar
#                continuum.
#
#           'm': mask the line when fitting the stellar continuum but do
#                NOT fit the line itself
#
#           's': defines a sky line that should be masked.  When masked,
#                the wavelength of the line is NOT adjusted for the
#                redshift of the object spectrum.
#   LINE:
#       Type of line, which can be either 'l' for a line or 'dN' for a
#       doublet.  For doublets, the 'N' indicates the line ID of the
#       other line in the doublet.  The line to which the doublet is
#       tied should have LINE='l'; for example, if emission line with
#       ID=4 has line='d3', then the emission line with ID=3 must have
#       LINE='l'.
#   AMPL:
#       Relative intensity of the gas emission (positive) or absorption
#       (negative) lines with respect to the doublet.  Therefore, this
#       should most often be unity if LINE='l' and indicate the ratio of
#       line INTENSITY if LINE='dN'.
#   VEL:
#       Guess for the velocity offset with respect to the galaxy
#       systemic velocity (km/s).
#   SIG:
#       Guess for the velocity dispersion (km/s).
#   MODE:
#       Fitting mode for the line, which can be either 'f' to fit the
#       line independently or 'tN' to set both the velocity and
#       dispersion to be tied to a fitted line (MODE='f') with ID=N.
#       One can also force only the velocities to be tied using 'vN' or
#       only the velocity dispersions to be tied using 'sN'.
