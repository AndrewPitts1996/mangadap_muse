[DIDNOTUSE]
 value = 0
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as DONOTUSE or FORESTAR by the DRP, or as LOW_SPECCOV, LOW_SNR, or NONE_IN_STACK in the binning step.
 
[FORESTAR]
 value = 1
 descr = Pixel was ignored because it was flagged as FORESTAR by the DRP.

[LOW_SNR]
 value = 2
 descr = Pixel was ignored because the S/N estimate of the spectrum was below the set threshold; see header keyword SCMINSN.

[OUTSIDE_RANGE]
 value = 3
 descr = Pixel was ignored during the stellar-continuum fit because it was outside the designated spectral range of the fit; see the header keyword FITWAVE.

[ARTIFACT]
 value = 4
 descr = Pixel was ignored during the stellar-continuum fit because it was designated as containing an artifact.

[EML_REGION]
 value = 5
 descr = Pixel was ignored during the stellar-continuum fit because it contains an emission-line.

[TPL_PIXELS]
 value = 6
 descr = These pixels were removed to ensure that the number of template spectral pixels was >= the number of fitted object pixels during the stellar-continuum fit.

[TRUNCATED]
 value = 7
 descr = This region was truncated to avoid convolution errors at the edges of the spectral range during the stellar-continuum fit.
